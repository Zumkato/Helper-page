# Pentest Assistant

A minimal skeleton for a penetration testing assistant with AI-powered
suggestions, note summarization and report generation.

## Features
- Track targets and receive suggested attack steps.
- Summarize raw notes into report-ready prose.
- Assemble findings into Markdown/HTML reports.

This project provides only a lightweight starting point; most functions
return placeholder responses until an LLM API key is configured.
